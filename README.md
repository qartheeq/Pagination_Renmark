# Pagination_Renmark


 As part of implementation following things have been done.

 Created a reusable pagination component
Created reusable search component
Created component to display client details in a table
If the user clicks on search button I make a api call to backend to search the clients by value entered in search box.
if the user clicks  previous/next button the api call is made to fetch the list of clients of next or previous page respectively
